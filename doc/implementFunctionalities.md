# Implement Functionalities


In the purpose to create the great video game which will be LabyGame, we need a few functionalities. 

    This is the list :
        - a graphic interface : we need this one to obtain the visual aspect we want
        - a control interface : with this one, the player can move the character 
        - a sound interface : a good game need good scores
        - a menu interface : this one is to choose options, play or exit the game
        - a fight interface : sometimes, hero needs to fight his enemies
        - a exploration interface : sometimes, hero needs to explore around him
        - an inventory : where an hero stows his items
